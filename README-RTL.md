When you need youd AdminLTE for some language that have right to left law, like persian, ordu or arabic, you need have side menu in right position of page,
So from we solved this problem by two step!

only add AdminLTE.min.css to <head> tag and add rtl class in your wrapper block.

In RTL mode you must use change all "pull-left" class by "pull-right" and must change all "pull-right" to "pull-left",
but if you don't have any time, or if you do not get bored, only add this class beside rtl class in wrapper block: "rtl-inv"

this will inverse pull-right and pull-left properties in your side menu.

enjoy AdminLTE RTL.
